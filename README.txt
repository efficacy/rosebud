Rosebud is the name for the Stringtree generic entity/attribute storage system which has been floating about 
in a more specific form as part of several projects over the years. Now it has its own project.

The Rosebud source was originally stored at git@efficacy.unfuddle.com:efficacy/rosebud.git

As with other Stringtree projects, Rosebud is dual licensed. You may use it under the terms of either
